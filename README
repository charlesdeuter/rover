# A quick coding excercise done in ruby
# The grid represents an x by y length grid of an arbitrary unit size
# Rovers can then be located on the grid and directed to move or turn
# The state can then be accessed through attr_accessors

#install dependencies
bundle install --path .bundle

#run unit tests
bundle exec rspec
